# TO-DO List Exercise
# [DEMO](https://idcuadro82.github.io/todo-app-vanilla-javascript/)

## 🚨 PLEASE READ THE WHOLE DOCUMENT BEFORE STARTING 🚨

## 🛠 Requirements

- Git: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node JS (Version 8.x and up): [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## ⚙️ Install dependencies and run the app

- `npm install`
- `npm run setup`
- `npm run start`

## ⏰ 3 hours to complete the test (Mandatory)

- Remember to send a first version after the first 3 hours.
- Please do not install any aditional dependencies for the first 3 hours.

## 💪🏻 24 extra hours to show off your skills (Optional)

- After the 3 hours, optionaly you can have 24 hours to keep working on the test to show off your skills.
- If you are done with the backlog, please add to the project whatever you think would be useful in **real life project** with **real teammates**.
- Please do not migrate the project to any framework. Keep it vanilla.
- Installing new dependencies is ok within this phase.
  - Keep in mind that you might need to add some kind of bundler.

## 📖 Considerations

- Review project structure and follow the same patterns.
- Each single TO-DO item should be able to change its state without affecting others.
- Create new components if you need to.
- Use native checkboxes (do not use the design as a reference for them).
- Your code should work fine at least in Google Chrome.
- Please do not `git commit` for any reason at any point since this will break our diff strategy that should be used at the end.

## 📋 Backlog

### HTML

- Fix all the HTML semantic issues that you can find.

### CSS

- Implement the design for the large viewport.
- Implement the design for the medium viewport.
- The UI should change based on the viewport size.

### JS

- Connect with real data using the `/todos` endpoint.
- Render the whole list of items.
- Implement an initial filter for the initial load based in a constant flag.
- Make each TO-DO item to change its `completed` state and color when clicking the checkbox.
- Implement the top filter component functionality.

## 🏁 At the end of the test

- Run `npm run diff` and send `to-do-list-exercise.diff` file back to us. **DO NOT ZIP THE WHOLE PROJECT**.
  - If you are sending the 24 hours optional changes, please run the same command again.
- Please do not share this test with anyone else.
